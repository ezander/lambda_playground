# λ playground

An interactive browser-based playground for an untyped lambda dialect with step-by-step beta/eta reduction, definitions, and syntax highlighting. Inspired by [hbr's Lambda Calculus evaluator](https://hbr.github.io/Lambda-Calculus/lambda2/lambda.html).

> 99% vibe-coded — all implementation by [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code).

## Features

- Multi-line input: definitions and expressions, one per line (or `;`-separated)
- Named definitions with eager expansion into subsequent lines
- Shorthand `f x y := e` desugars to `f := \x y. e`
- `π expr` print statements: evaluate an expression to normal form and show it in the output panel
- `≡ expr1 expr2` equivalence assertions: checks alpha-beta equivalence; green/red ≡ in output; halts further output on failure
- Live parsing on every keystroke with clickable error locations
- Syntax highlighting: defined names, lambda binders, bound/free variables, comments
- Greek letters in identifiers (ω, Ω, Θ, …); logic symbols as operator identifiers (∧, ∨, ¬, →, ↔, ⊤, ⊥, ⊕, ⊗, ∘, ≠, ∅); backtick-quoted identifiers for arbitrary names
- Two-phase beta reduction: optionally show `e[x:=a]` substitution as an intermediate step
- Eta reduction as a separate step
- Step-by-step or batch evaluation; continue after pausing
- Normal-order (leftmost-outermost) beta reduction with capture-avoiding substitution
- Alpha-equivalence matching: history entries show the definition name when a result matches
- Toggle between pretty-printed syntax and interactive collapsible AST view
- Named save/load slots in browser local storage; slot picker dropdown; download as plain text
- Share button: encodes editor content into a URL (LZ-compressed) and copies it to the clipboard
- Kino (fullscreen) mode for the editor
- Select text and press `(`, `[`, or `{` to wrap in brackets; `` ` `` wraps in backticks (or inserts paired backticks with cursor inside when nothing is selected)

## Syntax

```
λx. body             # lambda abstraction (\ also accepted)
λx y z. body         # multi-param (desugars to nested abstractions)
f x y                # application (left-associative)
e[x:=a]              # substitution: desugars to (λx. e) a
+ m n := m S n       # operator identifier as definition name
<= m n := ...        # = is also an operator char: <=, >=, ==, != all valid
# comment            # rest of line ignored
;                    # statement separator (same as newline)
```

### Identifiers

Plain identifiers are any non-empty sequence of ASCII letters, digits, underscores, and Greek letters (full block `\u0370–\u03FF`, excluding λ and π which are keywords; α, β, η, ∀, ∃, ≡, ⊢ are reserved). Operator identifiers may also start with free logic symbols (∧ ∨ ¬ → ↔ ⊤ ⊥ ⊕ ⊗ ∘ ≠ ∅), enabling definitions like `∧ p q := p q false`.

Backtick-quoted identifiers allow arbitrary names (spaces, operators, etc.):

```
`church 0` := λf x. x
`church 0`              # evaluates the definition
```

### In-source config

Lines starting with `#!` set runtime options for that program run (override the settings dialog; reset when the run ends):

```
#! max-steps=500         # set both max-steps-print and max-steps-ident
#! max-steps-print=500   # beta step limit for π statements
#! max-steps-ident=500   # beta step limit for definition matching/normalization
#! max-history=20        # max history entries stored (panel scrolls)
#! max-size=5000         # max AST nodes before reduction halts
#! no-normalize-defs     # disable definition body normalization at load time
```

### Definitions

```
true  := λx y. x          # define a name
false := λx y. y
and p q := p q false      # shorthand: f x y := e  means  f := λx y. e

π and true false          # print to output panel (normalized)
≡ and true false false    # assert  and true false ≡ false  (left-assoc: last term is rhs)
and true false            # last expression line is what gets evaluated
```

Definitions are expanded eagerly. The last non-definition line is loaded and evaluated. `π` and `≡` lines are evaluated immediately and shown in the output panel; they do not affect the loaded expression. A failing `≡` assertion halts further output.

## Toolbar

Below the editor, a compact toolbar provides three groups:

- **examples** — dropdown; selecting an entry replaces the editor content with a complete example program
- **insert** — dropdown; selecting an entry inserts a block of definitions at the current cursor line
- **storage** — name field + `▾` slot picker + load / save / delete / download; saves named snippets to browser local storage; overwrite and delete both ask for confirmation

## Controls

| load | F6 | Parse and load the current expression into the history |
| β-step | F10 | One beta-reduction step |
| η-step | F11 | One eta-reduction step (λx. f x → f) |

## Development

```bash
npm run dev      # start Vite dev server with hot reload
npm run build    # TypeScript compile + production bundle to /dist
npm test         # run Vitest unit tests
tsc --noEmit     # type-check without emitting
```

## Architecture

```
user input → lexer.ts → parser.ts (CST + visitor) → ast.ts → eval.ts → App.tsx
```

| `parser/lexer.ts` | Chevrotain tokenizer |
| `parser/parser.ts` | CST parser + AST visitor; `parseProgram` handles multi-line input and definitions; attaches source positions for highlighting |
